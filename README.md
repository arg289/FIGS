# First Cultivated Fruit
Ficus carica, the common fig, is recognized by many to be the first fruit cultivated by humans. It has been used for food, medicine, and spirituality. Grown as a tree or a large shrub, the fig itself is not technically a fruit, but it’s a syconium. A syconium is a fleshy expansion of a stem with a hollow area within which many tiny flowers grow. These tiny flowers develop into tiny fruits. Therefore, the fig can be thought to be filled with many tiny fruits, rather than as a single fruit.

# First Cultivated Fruit
F. carica has been grown, bred and enjoyed by humans for over 11,000 years. Originating in Asia Minor (part of modern day Turkey), it is now naturalized throughout much of Asia and North America, and is cultivated for production, and as an ornamental across the globe. Its spread was facilitated in large part by trade and the movement of peoples.

# First Cultivated Fruit
Figs prefer a subtropical environment, and individual trees in some areas have been known to grow to be 100s of years old, with the oldest being 285 years old. F. carica is the largest genus in the Moraceae family, which includes Mulberry and Osage Orange. All Moraceae have laticifers, networks of specialized cells that produce a milky white latex sap for healing in response to damage.

Most modern varieties of the common fig are parthenocarpic, meaning they do not require pollination to set “fruit,” and they do not produce viable seed. These must be propagated by cutting. Other cultivars (Smyrna, or the California-grown hybrids Calimyrna) must be pollinated in order to set fruit. This is done by a species of wasp, Blastophega psenes (Anjam, et al., 2017).
