# First Cultivated Fruit
_Ficus carica_, the common fig, is recognized by many to be the first fruit cultivated by humans. It has been used for food, medicine, and spirituality. Grown as a tree or a large shrub, the fig itself is not technically a fruit, but it’s a syconium. A syconium is a fleshy expansion of a stem with a hollow area within which many tiny flowers grow. These tiny flowers develop into tiny fruits. Therefore, the fig can be thought to be filled with many tiny fruits, rather than as a single fruit.

_F. carica_ has been grown, bred and enjoyed by humans for over 11,000 years. Originating in Asia Minor (part of modern day Turkey), it is now naturalized throughout much of Asia and North America, and is cultivated for production, and as an ornamental across the globe. Its spread was facilitated in large part by trade and the movement of peoples.

Figs prefer a subtropical environment, and individual trees in some areas have been known to grow to be 100s of years old, with the oldest being 285 years old. F. carica is the largest genus in the Moraceae family, which includes Mulberry and Osage Orange. All Moraceae have laticifers, networks of specialized cells that produce a milky white latex sap for healing in response to damage.

Most modern varieties of the common fig are parthenocarpic, meaning they do not require pollination to set “fruit,” and they do not produce viable seed. These must be propagated by cutting. Other cultivars (Smyrna, or the California-grown hybrids Calimyrna) must be pollinated in order to set fruit. This is done by a species of wasp, Blastophega psenes [^1](Anjam, et al., 2017).

## Blastophega Wasp

The life cycle of Blastophega psenes is inextricably tied to that of Ficus carica. They spend their whole life cycle inside the fig, although they only live 1-2 days. Wasps hatch inside short-style female flowers inside the syconia of ‘male’ trees (sex determination in fig is complex, but some trees are functionally male and others have only female flowers). Male wasps emerge first, and then fertilize the yet-unemerged female wasps while they are still inside the flower ovaries in which they grow. The wingless males live and die within the syconium. The female wasps mature at the same moment as the pollen on the male flowers, so as they crawl out to begin their journey, they are dusted with fig pollen. (Condit, 1920) The female wasps then find a new syconium in which to lay their eggs. If the syconium they enter has the dominant G allele, its flowers will have short styles and the wasp will be able to oviposit eggs, and will pollinate the flowers while doing so. The seeds of those flowers are almost all doomed to be eaten by the young wasp larvae that develop within the ovaries. If, however, the female wasps choose a syconium with recessive g flowers, then they are unable to lay eggs because the styles are longer than their ovipositors, however during their attempt, they will pollinate the flowers, allowing them to set fertile seeds [^2](Armstrong, 1988).

## Early Domestic Fig in the Jordan Valley 

In this article, Kislev et al. investigates carbonized fig fruits and drupelets found in Gilgal I, an early Neolithic village in the Lower Jordan Valley. The remains date back to 11,400-11,200 years ago, prior even to the domestication of cereals. The authors suggest that because the figs found were from parthenocarpic trees(varieties that mainly produce seedless figs that must be propagated by cutting) that this finding is evidence of propagation and cultivation, possibly the first known evidence of domestication.

However, this finding is not without controversy. Lev-Yadun et al. argues that even parthenocarpic varieties may sometimes produce fruit with viable seed and that these varieties could have grown in the area randomly.

In a final rebuttal, Kislev et al. makes the argument that while there were seeded varieties of fig found at nearby sites, only the parthenocarpic varieties were found at Gilgal I, suggesting that cuttings of these varieties were intentionally planted in the settlement.

## Medicinal Properties

According to WebMD, a fig contains 37 calories, 0 grams of fat, no cholesterol, 1 milligram of sodiu, 10 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram of fiber, 8 grams of sugar and no protein. They are a good source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Iron, Potassium and Magnesium. 
Aside from the nutritional benefits, figs contain many medicinally active compounds as well. According to an article by Mawa et al., they contain high quantities of phenolic compounds such as proanthocyanadids (the same compounds that are active in red wine and tea) making them an excellent antioxidant. All parts of the plant have been used by various cultures in traditional medicines to treat a wide variety of ailments- it has been used to treat coughs in Malaysia, for example, and as a laxative in India. Fig juice has sometimes been mixed with honey to treat hemorrhage. Its medicinal properties have been noted by modern researchers as well, and it is used in cancer research, and is being investigated as an antispasmodic as well. 
Though rather different from the common fig, other varieties also have medicinal qualities. The latex produced by certain fig species (such as F. Insipida, F. Maxima, F. Obtusifolia and F. Paraensis) is used in South America to treat a range of medical conditions including gastrointestinal parasites and osteomuscular problems. The bark and leaves of certain fig trees also have medicinal properties and are often boiled and drunk in places like Ghana, Madagascar, and Zaire. 
       
## Importance of Figs in Culture 
       
Figs are well documented in antiquity given their very early domestication. They have a significant and illustrious history of interaction with humans that spans back thousands of years. It is claimed that Alexander the Great camped his army beneath the branches of an enormous Indian Banyan or F. Benghalensis. Plato extolled the virtues of the fig to his students and was known by the epithet of “fig eater”  because of his great love for them. The founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, were said to have been suckled beneath a wild fig tree, the F. Ruminalis.

They are especially present in the realm of religion. For the Ancient Egyptians, the fig symbolized rebirth and divinity as in their mythology a fig tree sprouted from the corpse of the god Osiris. In Abrahamic theology, the first tree mentioned by the Bible in the prosperous Garden of Eden. As such, the fig is often seen as a symbol of prosperity and a blessing from God, as well as being held by some as a symbol of Israel itself. In addition, many scholars in the Jewish and Islamic tradition hold that it was a fig, not an apple, that was the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve ate (side note: the idea that it was an apple comes from a later play on words in Latin, the word for apple in that language is the same as the word for evil: malus). Finally, Adam and Eve were said to have used fig leaves to cover themselves after eating the fruit of good and evil. This is why with many classic statues, the figures are depicted with fig leaves covering the genitals.
       
The fig is also very important to Buddhist tradition, as it was under this tree that the Buddha was said to have reached enlightenment. Gautama sat beneath a F. Religiosa in meditation and emerged as the Buddha, the enlightened one. Because of this, the plant is known as the “Bodhi” tree. Similarly, there are many Hindu traditions associated with the fig. Brahma, a very important god in Hindu theology, was said to have transformed into an Indian Banyan or F. Benghalensis. The planting of this tree and its perceived female counterpart, the F. Religiosa, is seen as a good deed and is highly encouraged. These trees are considered very sacred in Hindu theology and they populate many of their temples. Felling or damaging one comes with severe consequences across all castes, even the seedlings are protected.
