# First Cultivated Fruit
_Ficus carica_, the common fig, is recognized by many to be the first fruit cultivated by humans. It has been used for food, medicine, and spirituality. Grown as a tree or a large shrub, the fig itself is not technically a fruit, but it’s a syconium. A syconium is a fleshy expansion of a stem with a hollow area within which many tiny flowers grow. These tiny flowers develop into tiny fruits. Therefore, the fig can be thought to be filled with many tiny fruits, rather than as a single fruit.

_F. carica_ has been grown, bred and enjoyed by humans for over 11,000 years. Originating in Asia Minor (part of modern day Turkey), it is now naturalized throughout much of Asia and North America, and is cultivated for production, and as an ornamental across the globe. Its spread was facilitated in large part by trade and the movement of peoples.

Figs prefer a subtropical environment, and individual trees in some areas have been known to grow to be 100s of years old, with the oldest being 285 years old. F. carica is the largest genus in the Moraceae family, which includes Mulberry and Osage Orange. All Moraceae have laticifers, networks of specialized cells that produce a milky white latex sap for healing in response to damage.

Most modern varieties of the common fig are parthenocarpic, meaning they do not require pollination to set “fruit,” and they do not produce viable seed. These must be propagated by cutting. Other cultivars (Smyrna, or the California-grown hybrids Calimyrna) must be pollinated in order to set fruit. This is done by a species of wasp, Blastophega psenes [^1](Anjam, et al., 2017).

## Blastophega Wasp

The life cycle of Blastophega psenes is inextricably tied to that of Ficus carica. They spend their whole life cycle inside the fig, although they only live 1-2 days. Wasps hatch inside short-style female flowers inside the syconia of ‘male’ trees (sex determination in fig is complex, but some trees are functionally male and others have only female flowers). Male wasps emerge first, and then fertilize the yet-unemerged female wasps while they are still inside the flower ovaries in which they grow. The wingless males live and die within the syconium. The female wasps mature at the same moment as the pollen on the male flowers, so as they crawl out to begin their journey, they are dusted with fig pollen. (Condit, 1920) The female wasps then find a new syconium in which to lay their eggs. If the syconium they enter has the dominant G allele, its flowers will have short styles and the wasp will be able to oviposit eggs, and will pollinate the flowers while doing so. The seeds of those flowers are almost all doomed to be eaten by the young wasp larvae that develop within the ovaries. If, however, the female wasps choose a syconium with recessive g flowers, then they are unable to lay eggs because the styles are longer than their ovipositors, however during their attempt, they will pollinate the flowers, allowing them to set fertile seeds [^2](Armstrong, 1988).

## Map

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
